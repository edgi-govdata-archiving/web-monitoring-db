# MergedPage keeps track of pages that were merged into others so we can
# support old links by redirecting to the page they were merged into.
# - The primary key is the ID of the page that was merged and removed
# - `target_uuid` is the ID of the page it was merged into
# - `audit_data` is any useful JSON data about the page (usually a frozen
#   copy of its attributes).
