parameters:
  sort:
    name: sort
    in: query
    required: false
    type: string
    description: >
      Sort the results. This should be a comma-separated list of sort
      values, where each value is in the form `field:order`, e.g.
      `title:asc,url:desc`. You can sort by any field on the result
      objects.

  chunk:
    name: chunk
    in: query
    description: pagination parameter
    required: false
    type: integer
    default: 1

  chunk_size:
    name: chunk_size
    in: query
    description: number of items per chunk
    required: false
    type: integer
    default: 100

  include_total:
    name: include_total
    in: query
    required: false
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >
      If true, inlude the number of total results across all chunks as a field
      called `meta.total_results`. For example, querying
      `/api/v0/pages?include_total` would show the total number of page
      records in the database in that field.

      Note that `links.last` will only be populated if you are already on the
      last chunk *unless this parameter is set to true* (the URL of the
      “last” chunk can’t be determined without counting all possible results).

        - pages and versions
      summary: Get one version per day of a specific page.
      description: >
        ⚠️ This endpoint is experimental, and may change!

        Use this endpoint to get a lighter-weight history of a page's versions
        by sampling at most one version per day. The result is an array of
        objects representing each day, each with a complete Version object and a
        count of versions on that day. Only days with captured versions are
        included.

        If you are displaying a history for a particular page (particularly a
        frequently captured page, like `https://www.epa.gov/`), this can be a
        more efficient and quick way to load the relevant information you might
        need, rather than requesting every version of the page from
        `/pages{page_id}/versions`.

        As with other list endpoints, results are chunked. Follow the
        `links.next` property of the response to get the next chunk of results.
        (You can also iterate by manually making requests with sequential
        `capture_time` parameters, but the `links.next` property willskip past
        empty time ranges automatically for more efficient querying.)

        metadata and headers of the original response, use the
        `/versions/{version_id}` route.

        Unlike other API responses, the `Content-Type` may not be
        `application/json`. Instead, it will be the appropriate type for
        the response body, or `application/octet-stream` if the orignal
        response had no content type or the content type was not captured.

The list can be a newline-delimited JSON stream (sent with the `application/x-json-stream` content type) or a JSON array (sent with `application/json` content type). The stream is preferable, since processing many versions using it is more efficient. Each version object should conform to the `ImportableVersion` schema below.
