# Make sessions available only to requests from the same host as the server.

# This means sessions work for people browsing this site directly, but not for
# cross-origin requests or requests not coming from browsers (unless the Referer
# header is manually added). Cross-origin requests must use a different,
# self-managed means of authentication (e.g. HTTP auth, tokens, etc).
#
# It generally mitigates attacks where a random web site might make a request
# to the APIs this service hosts and be able to get data or make changes on a
# browsing user's behalf without their knowledge.
